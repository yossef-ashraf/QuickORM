# db/orm

This repository contains a project that leverages ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) technology to manage and interact with databases in a convenient and efficient manner. The project demonstrates how to use ORM to manipulate databases through code without needing to write SQL queries directly.

## Features

- **Simple API:** Easily manipulate databases using objects and classes.
- **Full CRUD Support:** Insert, read, update, and delete data effortlessly.
- **Dynamic Queries:** Build SQL queries dynamically with `QueryBuilder`.
- **Relationship Management:** Handle relationships between tables, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
- **Database Compatibility:** Works with most relational databases supported by PDO.

## Installation

To install `quickhelper/quickorm` via Composer, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
composer require quickhelper/quickorm
```

## Basic Usage

### Setting up a Database Connection

Configure the database connection settings in your configuration in config/database.php ;

### Creating a Model

Create a model that represents a table in your database:

```php
use QuickORM\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'users';
}
```

### CRUD Operations

- **Insert a New Record:**

```php
$user = new User();
$user->name = 'John Doe';
$user->email = 'john@example.com';
$user->save();
```

- **Read a Record:**

```php
$user = User::find(1);
echo $user->name;
```

- **Update a Record:**

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->name = 'Jane Doe';
$user->save();
```

- **Delete a Record:**

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->delete();
```

### Custom Queries

Use `QueryBuilder` to create custom SQL queries:

```php
use QuickORM\QueryBuilder;

$results = QueryBuilder::table('users')
    ->where('age', '>', 30)
    ->get();
```

### Relationship Management

Define relationships between models:

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'posts';

    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
}

class User extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'users';

    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}
```
